## How to use
To use the notebooks, we recommend you to load them into [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tobhey/NoRBERT).
Please make sure that you use a GPU (in Colab: Edit -> Notebook settings -> Hardware accelerator: GPU).

In each notebook is a cell with the configuration that can be tuned.
Make sure to correctly set paths to data folders/files as well as for logging output.
We recommend you to load the data in your Google Drive, from where it can be imported.
Make sure to adapt the corresponding paths in the notebooks.
