# Apply pretrained NoRBERT models
The included notebooks enable to load a pretrained NoRBERT model and apply it to an input requirement.

We provide models for Task 4 and the classification of functional requirement concerns.
Note that these models are trained on the whole respective dataset and therefore weren't used to produce any of the results.
We would love to provide the models we used to produce the results, but as we mostly used cross-validation this would result in a huge amount of model files which would be confusing and considering their file size not applicable.

Each model (.pkl) is accompanied by a .config file displaying the configuration used to train the model.
